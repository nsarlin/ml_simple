* Presentation
This library aims to provide many different models of machine learning
algorithms (eg: logistic reg, SVM, neural networks...). The main goal
for me is to better understand how thos algorithms work by iplementing
them. 

Thus, it does not claim to provide better performances, results or
ease of use than any other existing implementation.
