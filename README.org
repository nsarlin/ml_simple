* Presentation
This library aims to provide many different models of machine learning
algorithms (eg: logistic reg, SVM, neural networks...). The main goal
for me is to better understand how those algorithms work by implementing
them. 

Thus, it does not claim to provide better performances, results or
ease of use than any other existing implementation.

Files:
- Parser.py: Parser for idx file format, used for example in MNIST
  dataset
- LogisticReg.py: Implementation of logistic regression

* Tests and example
It is possible to try this library by testing it against the MNIST
dataset:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import Parser as p
  import LogisticReg as lr

  # Loading datasets
  # xval is the cross validation dataset. Eventhoug it is not used in
  # this code, it should be used for tuning the parameters of the
  # algorithm.
  train_img = p.IdxParser("mnist/train-img").parse()
  train_lbl = p.IdxParser("mnist/train-lbl").parse()
  test_img = p.IdxParser("mnist/test-img").parse()
  test_lbl = p.IdxParser("mnist/test-lbl").parse() 
  xval_img = train_img[50000:].reshape((10000, 28*28))
  xval_lbl = train_lbl[50000:]
  train_img = train_img[:50000].reshape((50000, 28*28))
  train_lbl = train_lbl[:50000]

  # Learning
  Theta = lr.train_all(train_img, train_lbl, 10)

  # Testing against test set
  acc = 0
  for (img, lbl) in zip(test_img, test_lbl):
      if lr.evaluate(img) == lbl:
          acc += 1
  print(acc/10000)
#+END_SRC

This evaluation code gave a success ration of 0.90 (Meaning that 9
over 10 images in the test set were correctly guessed).
